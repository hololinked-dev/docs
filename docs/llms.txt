## Description

hololinked is a beginner-friendly pythonic tool suited for instrumentation control and data acquisition over network (IoT & SCADA).

As a novice, one may have a requirement to control and capture data from hardware,
for example in an electronics or science lab, and may want to show the data in a dashboard, provide a PyQt GUI, or run
automated scripts; hololinked can help. Even for isolated desktop applications or a small setup without networking,
it is still possible to separate the concerns of the tools that interact with the hardware and the hardware itself.

If the user is a web developer or an industry professional looking for a web standards compatible (high-speed) IoT runtime,
hololinked can be a decent choice. By conforming to W3C Web of Things, one can expect a consistent API and flexible
bidirectional message flow to interact with devices, irrespective of the underlying protocol.
Currently HTTP, MQTT & ZMQ are supported.

This implementation is based on RPC, built ground-up in python keeping both the 
latest web technologies and python principles in mind.

### Key Features

- **Web Standards Compatible**: Conforms to W3C Web of Things specifications for consistent APIs
- **Multiple Protocol Support**: HTTP, MQTT, and ZMQ protocols supported, new ones can be added
- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Suitable for technological changes and adding and removing features around the application
- **Pythonic Design**: Object-oriented approach with properties, actions, and events, build ground-up with 
modern web technologies and Python principles

### Core Concepts

Each device (Thing) is modeled with:

- **Properties**: Validated get-set attributes for settings, data, or network-accessible values
- **Actions**: Methods that command hardware to perform operations
- **Events**: Asynchronous messages or data streams to clients (alarms, measurements, etc.)

## Documentation Structure

### 1. Introduction
- Installation guide
- Resources and community links
- Contributing guidelines
- License information
- Protocol use cases
- Security scanning overview

**URL**: https://docs.hololinked.dev

### 2. Handbook (Beginners Guide)

Comprehensive tutorials for getting started with hololinked:

- **Expose Python Objects**: Overview of how to create network-accessible Things by subclassing from `Thing` class and instantiating properties, actions and events
- **Using Clients**: Working with ObjectProxy for consumer side applications, using scripting API directly with W3C WoT defined operations like read_property, write_property, subscribe_event, invoke_action etc., also using oneway, async etc.
- **Properties**: More about using properties, creating typed attributes with validation (String, Number, List, custom schemas, pydantic)
- **Actions**: More about using actions, decorating methods for remote invocation with payload validation
- **Events**: More about using events, data streaming, payload specifications
- **State Machine**: state machine based behavior control for Things
- **Protocols**: General protocol concepts, HTTP server usage, MQTT integration
- **Security**: Authentication mechanisms, basic auth like bcrypt & argon2, OAuth, API key auth

**URL**: https://docs.hololinked.dev/beginners-guide/articles/servers/

**Key Examples**:
- See the examples repository, there is lot of code for servers and clients both in gitlab and github

### 3. API Reference

from hololinked.core.properties import String, Number

class Spectrometer(Thing):
    serial_number = String(default="SN12345")
    integration_time = Number(default=10, bounds=(1, 100))
    
    @action()
    def measure_spectrum(self):
        # Perform measurement
        return {"wavelength": [...], "intensity": [...]}

# Create and serve
device = Spectrometer(id="/lab/spectrometer/1")
device.run()
```
