# State Machine

A finite state machine is a simplistic and intuitive constraint on the execution of properties and actions. 

API possibilities include:
- specify the list of allowed states, initial state and the writable properties and invokable actions for each state
- push state change events and read state as a property
- introspection of what action or property is available in any state
- specify transition callbacks when the state changes
